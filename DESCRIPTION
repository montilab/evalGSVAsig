Title: Evaluate genes from signature driving GSVA score in eset
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Author: Lina Kroehling
Maintainer: Lina Kroehling <lkroeh@bu.edu>
Description: Given a signature and expressionset, this tool first uses GSVA to 
    score each sample using the signature gene set. 
    The main purpose of this tool is to interrogate which genes are contributing most
    to the resulting GSVA scores. 
    This tool finds the correlation of each gene in the eset with the
    produced GSVA score, and returns a ranked list of genes, and two heatmaps.
